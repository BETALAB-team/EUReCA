The **E**nergy **U**rban **Re**sistance **C**apacitance **A**pproach provides an efficient and reliable Urban Building Energy Modeling platform, entirelly developed in Python, aiming at simulate and predict cites and urban areas energy consumption. The tool exploit a bottom-up modeling methodology, creatiing simple and useful dynamic building energy models.
