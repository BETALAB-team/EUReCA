# EUReCA

The **E**nergy **U**rban **Re**sistance **C**apacitance **A**pproach provides an efficient and reliable Urban Building Energy Modeling platform, entirelly developed in Python, aiming at simulating and predicting cites and urban areas energy consumption. The tool exploit a bottom-up modeling methodology, creatiing simple and useful dynamic building energy models.

This research project has been developed within the [BETALAB](https://research.dii.unipd.it/betalab/) research group of the University of Padua

## Set up
The tool is distributed via GitHub repository. It can be freely cloned with git, `git clone https://github.com/BETALAB-team/EUReCA.git`, or clicking on the **code** bottom and downloading the zip file.

In the reposotory it is also included an RC.yml, which provides the python packages needed to run the EUReCA simulation. The virtual environment can be easily set up using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) package manager. Using the comand line: 
```
conda -env 
```
